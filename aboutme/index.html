    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Damian Ahamba but I go by Stanley, my middle name. I am Originally from Nigeria but now live in Alberta, Canada. I am married and we have three kids (2 girls, 1 boy). I have been a member of the church for over 25 years and I served a full-time mission in Lagos East Mission, Nigeria. In my spare time, I like to play/watch soccer. Chelsea FC fan here!
    <p>I am just testing the waters here since I am not yet certain what degree to pursue. But I thought I should start with some programming classes to see how it goes.</p>
    <p>I am looking forwaard to learning and sharing knowledge with you all.</p>
    <p>Thanks</p>
    <p>Stanley</p>
